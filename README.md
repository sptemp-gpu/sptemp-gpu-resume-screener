# AI-Powered Resume Screening System

This is a web application that uses AI to screen resumes and match them to a job description (JD). It takes a resume (in PDF format) and a job description, and uses **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** to calculate a match score based on the relevance of the resume to the job description.

## Features
- Upload resumes (PDF format)
- Paste job description (JD)
- AI-based matching and score calculation

## Technologies Used
- **Flask**: Python web framework
- **scikit-learn**: Machine learning library for vectorization and cosine similarity
- **PyMuPDF**: PDF text extraction library
- **HTML/CSS**: Frontend for file upload and input
